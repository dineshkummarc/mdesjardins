## TOdo


 - initialisation: problem on secton loading...

 - scrollBase condition too restrictive (doesn't rerutn to base anymore)
 - scrollBase fired multiple time, cause Queing. Maybe stopAnim?
 

 
 - purple underline on MD.
 
 - special font? orator
 
 - higher-res images for BG on info...
 
 
 - propper width of image container... maybe use 2:3 ratio to do average math with the number of image inside the div??
 
 
 - make CSS compatible (add browser suffixes)
 
 - test on IE...
 
 - empty/hide alternate content (it jumps on load..)
